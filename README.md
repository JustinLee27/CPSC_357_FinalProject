## Design Heuristics and Guidelines

**Design Heuristics**
- **Visibility of System Status**: The app provides immediate feedback on each guess and displays the remaining time in timed mode, keeping users informed about their progress.
- **User Control and Freedom**: Users can easily navigate between the main menu, game view, and settings, with options to start a new game or return to the main menu at any time.

- **Consistency**: Standard iOS UI elements such as buttons, navigation links, and text fields are used, ensuring a familiar experience for users.
- **Feedback**: Clear feedback is provided for user actions, such as colored feedback for each letter in guesses and alerts for game outcomes.
- **User Control**: Users can control their experience, with options to play again, give up, or return to the main menu at any point.
